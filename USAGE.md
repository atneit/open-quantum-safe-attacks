# Usage of Open Quantum Safe Attack FrameWork (OQS-AFW)

This program is comprised of many different subprogram designed to aid in the development and research of new side-channel attacks against the `liboqs` library.

Most of these commands are of no use for new users but simply remain as a collection of routines that might or might not be usefull in any future endeavors.

The **actually usefull** commands, for new users are documented in this file.

## Paper: "Don't Reject This: Key-Recovery Timing Attacks Due to Rejection-Sampling in HQC and BIKE"

Here follows a simple list of "How To's" for generating various interesting results, most of which are showcased in the paper.
